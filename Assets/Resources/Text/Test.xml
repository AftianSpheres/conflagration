		<ger>Note that this language set was just sorta pulled out of my ass. I'm not seriously looking at localizations right now, to say the least - but having the schema defined is handy.</ger>
		<heb>You don't need to define translations in a particular order, either. If we want the German version of textbank "foo" line 4, we get that regardless of where the 'ger' tag is in the sequence.</heb>

			A "page" here, it should be noted, doesn't mean "one line of text." Pages can have newlines and control codes and shit!
			Pages are, essentially, the smallest blocks of text it makes sense to talk about independent of each other.
			A skill name can be one page, because that's something you can use on its own, but if you have a character
			delivering some long-ass monologue, that entire thing is going to be just one page, too.
			Don't worry about formatting or anything here, either. If you want to explicitly use a newline, go ahead, but if you don't line break, the game will automatically split even looonnnnngggg lines to fit in the textboxes you give it. Like so.

		<jpn>etc.</jpn>
		<spn>etc.</spn>
		<ita>Also, note that there should be graceful handling of cases where a line is missing one or more translations, for whatever reason.</ita>
